# Pushover

> A Rust library and command-line tool to interact with the Pushover.net API.

## Note

This library and command-line tool are woefully incomplete and primarily built on a "want to have" basis. If you find yourself missing something from the Pushover API and want it implemented, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Bauke/pushover/issues) for it (or email me at [me@bauke.xyz](mailto:me@bauke.xyz)).

## API

For the API documentation, see [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/pushover_api).

## CLI

To install the Pushover command-line tool, run `cargo install pushover_cli` or download a precompiled executable directly from [the Releases page](https://github.com/Bauke/pushover/releases/latest).

Then run `pushover --help` to see all the available options and subcommands.

## License

Both the API and command-line tool are licensed under either of [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://github.com/Bauke/pushover/blob/HEAD/LICENSE-Apache) or [MIT license](https://github.com/Bauke/pushover/blob/HEAD/LICENSE-MIT) at your option.

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in either crate by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
